Experience
----------

**Intern at DGZ Associates, LLC:**

Built outline for website using bootstrap. Incorportated Google Analytics API to collect data on website traffic. 

* [DGZ Associates, LLC](https://www.dgzassociates.com/index.html).

**RoboMagellan Team:**

Programmed an RC car to autonomously navigate and find items in an urban environment. Used an AI program, called You Only Look Once (YOLO), for object recognition, a Lidar for obstacle avoidance, and GPS/compass data for navigating through the course. Chassis and motor controller were from Traxxas, but we replaced the motor that came with the kit with a more powerful one. Almost everything was programmed in python.


Technical Experience
--------------------

Sudoku Solver
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages

:   **Python:** Learned in high school for my robotics team, RoboMagellan.
    
:   **Java:** Second language I learned, and the language I am most
    familiar with. Have done many projects with this language using
    object-oriented programming (OOP).

:   **C++:** First language I learned, comfortable using OOP. Made a 
    few mini-games with it, including a simple platformer and an
    incredibly buggy puzzle game.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **R**, **PowerShell**


Other things
